# GoBang_Battle

Here I used Professor HuanchenZhang's gobang template ,and extend it to a real $\textbf{human-robot gobang}$  !

The files I added are 
```
strategy.h      //  basic template of a strategy,  human interative included
robot1.h        // my designed robot
strategy.cpp
robot1.cpp
```

I also committed some subtle changes to other files.

To play, run  `build\main` and you can fight with my robot.

# What even more handsome -

### Hey, you can commit your own robot to fight, with human, or with other robots !
